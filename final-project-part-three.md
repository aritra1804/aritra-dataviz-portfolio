# The Final Data Story

[View My Final Data Story on Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-is-ai-really-an-energy-monster)


# Changes Made Since Part II

Since completing **Part II**, I made several key changes to improve the flow, design, and overall storytelling of my data story:

- **Removed Chapters for Better Flow:** Based on feedback, I removed the rigid chapter structure to create a **smoother, continuous narrative**. This made the story feel less like a report and more like an engaging, data-driven journey.

- **Strengthened the Call to Action (CTA):** I revised the final **CTA** to make it more **direct, actionable, and empowering**. The updated CTA focuses on encouraging readers to reflect on their energy usage while highlighting practical steps they can take.

- **Improved Formatting and Design:**  
  - I simplified the **text formatting** by reducing dense paragraphs, increasing white space, and using **callouts** for key data points.  
  - I adjusted **background colors and contrasts** to improve readability and reduce visual strain, especially in areas where users noted issues.  
  - Visual elements were aligned better with the text, using a **side-by-side layout** to make the story more cohesive and easier to follow.

- **Refined Data Visualizations:** I made visualizations **simpler and clearer**, with enhanced annotations and **proper citations** to strengthen credibility.

These changes aimed to make the data story more **engaging, reader-friendly**, and aligned with audience expectations.

## The Audience

The target audience for my final data story primarily includes:

- **General Public:** I aimed to make the story accessible to anyone, regardless of their technical background. This focus was driven by interview insights, where several users highlighted the importance of **simple, clear explanations** without technical jargon.

- **Industry Leaders & Policymakers:** The story is also intended for decision-makers in tech and energy sectors who are responsible for developing sustainable AI solutions. Specific sections on **local grid strain** and **renewable energy investments** were added to highlight policy-relevant insights.

- **Adjustments for the Audience:**  
  - I used **relatable analogies** (e.g., comparing ChatGPT queries to household energy use) to make complex data more digestible.  
  - I ensured that the **call to action** offered **realistic steps** that both the general public and policymakers could take.  
  - Feedback from user interviews influenced my decision to highlight **local impacts** of AI energy consumption, not just global statistics.

## Final Design Decisions

- **Color Palette & Visual Style:** I chose **cool blues and greys** to reflect energy themes, with **orange accents** to highlight key data points. **Dark mode** was used throughout to align with the slide themes and improve readability.

- **Typography:** I stuck with **Poppins**, Shorthand’s default font, for its clean and modern aesthetic, which enhances readability.

- **Data Visualization Choices:**  
  - I used a **blue color palette** for charts to maintain consistency.  
  - Visualizations were simplified and paired with **direct annotations** to help readers immediately grasp key insights.  
  - **Side-by-side layouts** were utilized to make complex data easier to understand.

- **Interactive Elements:** Scroll-driven storytelling and animated charts were used to maintain engagement while guiding the reader through the narrative.

## AI Acknowledgements

For this assignment, I used **ChatGPT** to help brainstorm and refine narrative structures, as well as to draft sections of text, which I then revised to match my voice and style. I also used ChatGPT to generate **initial data visualization sketches**, which I later refined using **Datawrapper**.

Additionally, I utilized **Grammarly** to proofread my work, ensuring proper grammar and improving the overall flow of the writing.

All visualizations were finalized using **Datawrapper**, and the storytelling was built using **Shorthand**.

# Final Thoughts

This project was both challenging and rewarding. One of the most exciting parts was **translating complex data into relatable stories**, like comparing ChatGPT energy use to household appliances — it made abstract data tangible.

The story itself went through a major evolution — I started with a **broad topic** on **AI adoption for business**, but it lacked focus. I then shifted to **AI’s energy consumption**, which provided a clearer direction but was initially **too data-heavy** and felt more like a report. Through feedback and iterations, I transformed it into a **narrative-driven story**, making the data more approachable and engaging.

If I had more time, I would have explored **more interactive visualizations**, like **line graphs showing trends over time with scroll effects** to make the data feel more dynamic and immersive. I also would have loved to conduct **more user interviews** to refine the story further.

What I’m most proud of is how the story evolved — starting as a data-heavy report and transforming into an **engaging narrative** that blends data, storytelling, and actionable insights. It taught me the power of **designing for the audience**, and how the smallest design tweaks can make a big difference in readability and engagement.

Overall, I’m excited about how it turned out and grateful for the feedback that guided me along the way!
