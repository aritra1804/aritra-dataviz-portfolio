# Home
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi, I’m Aritra Dutta – an aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Enthusiast passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With a strong foundation in Computer Science Engineering and Economics, and currently pursuing a Master’s in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, I aim to merge technical expertise with business acumen to create impactful solutions.

Throughout my journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, ranging from developing IoT-based smart farming solutions to building web apps for resource discovery during the COVID-19 pandemic. My internship experiences have honed my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and machine learning, empowering me to turn raw data into actionable insights.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy connecting with people from all walks of life. My experiences studying and working across India, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States have broadened my perspective, fueling my curiosity and adaptability.

When I’m not analyzing data or brainstorming solutions, you’ll find me exploring mythological stories from around the world, meeting people from different cultures, or planning my next travel adventure. I believe that every interaction and experience adds depth to the way we approach challenges, and I carry that mindset into all my projects.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my work or connect with me to collaborate on exciting opportunities. Let’s innovate together!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. **Effective Data Visualization Techniques**
- I want to master the art of creating clear, compelling, and impactful visualizations that effectively communicate insights to diverse audiences, including non-technical stakeholders.

2. **Crafting Narratives with Data**
- I aim to learn how to build cohesive and persuasive narratives around data, ensuring that my analyses not only inform but also engage and drive actionable decisions.

3. **Tools and Best Practices**
- I hope to deepen my understanding of industry-standard tools and frameworks for data storytelling, including design principles, audience targeting, and ethical considerations in data representation.
