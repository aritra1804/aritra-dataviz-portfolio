# Outline
## **High-Level Summary**
AI adoption is transforming industries, but businesses, policymakers, and developers face significant challenges in deployment, evaluation, and monitoring. This project will explore **where AI adoption stands today**, **the obstacles companies face**, and **what the future holds for AI development**.

Through **data visualizations**, we will tell the story of AI’s rapid growth, infrastructure challenges, monitoring difficulties, and the evolving trend toward **agentic workflows** and **customer-facing AI applications**. By highlighting real-world adoption patterns and industry trends, this project aims to **inform business leaders, developers, and policymakers about AI’s current impact and future trajectory**.

This story will be supported by **data from AI adoption reports, benchmarks, and industry surveys**, presented through **interactive visualizations and digital storytelling tools**.

## **Project Structure**
### **1. Introduction: The AI Revolution (😊 Happy)**  
- AI is no longer experimental—**25.1% of businesses have deployed AI**.  
- But adoption is **polarized**—another **25.1% are still developing their strategy**.  
- **Visualization:** **Stacked bar chart** showing AI adoption stages.  
- **Key Message:** AI adoption is growing, but not every business is ready yet.

### **2. What Are Companies Building? (😐 Neutral)**  
- AI is mostly used for **document parsing (59.7%)**, **chatbots (51.4%)**, and **natural language analytics (43.8%)**.  
- **Visualization:** **Bar chart** showing top AI use cases.  
- **Key Message:** AI is primarily used for **automation and enhancing customer interactions**.

### **3. Where Is AI Hosted? (😐 Neutral)**  
- **63.3% of companies use OpenAI’s cloud**, followed by **Azure (33.8%) and Anthropic (32.3%)**.  
- **Visualization:** **Bar chart** ranking AI hosting providers.  
- **Key Message:** **Cloud AI dominates**, but alternative providers are emerging.

### **4. The AI Development Landscape: In-House vs. Third-Party (😐 Neutral)**  
- **52.2% of companies build AI internally**, while **29.9% use third-party platforms**.  
- **Visualization:** **Pie chart** comparing AI development strategies.  
- **Key Message:** Companies favor **custom AI solutions**, but **third-party tools still play a role**.

### **5. Challenges in AI Adoption (😢 Sad)**  
- **57.1% struggle with hallucinations and prompt engineering**.  
- **38.3% cite a **lack of technical expertise** as a major barrier.  
- **Visualization:** **Bar chart** ranking AI adoption challenges.  
- **Key Message:** AI faces **technical and ethical hurdles that slow adoption**.

### **6. Evaluating AI: How Companies Test Models (😐 Neutral)**  
- **75.6% still rely on manual testing** rather than automated tools.  
- **Visualization:** **Bar chart** showing AI evaluation methods.  
- **Key Message:** **Most AI testing is still manual**, highlighting the need for better evaluation frameworks.

# Method and medium
This project will be built using **interactive storytelling tools and data visualization platforms**:  
- **Shorthand** for digital storytelling.  
- **Tableau or Plotly** for interactive data visualizations.  
- **GitHub Pages** for project hosting and documentation.  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis and visualization processing.  

📌 **Final Deliverable:**  
An **interactive, stand-alone project** combining **Shorthand storytelling with data visualizations** to communicate insights effectively.
