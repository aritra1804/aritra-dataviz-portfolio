# **Is AI Inevitable for Business?**

## **Outline**

### **High-Level Summary**
AI is no longer a futuristic concept, rather it is a key driver of business transformation. From **automating tasks** to **enhancing customer interactions**, AI is increasingly integrated into business operations. However, **adoption remains polarized** as companies struggle with **deployment, security risks, and technical expertise gaps**.

This project presents a **data-driven narrative** on AIâ€™s **adoption, infrastructure, and challenges**, supported by **real-world industry reports and benchmarks**. Through interactive **visual storytelling**, we will explore **how businesses are using AI, where AI is hosted, who is developing AI, and what challenges remain**.

The goal is to provide **business leaders, policymakers, and developers** with actionable insights into **AIâ€™s present impact and its trajectory for the future**.

## **Project Structure**

### **1. AI Model Releases Over Time**

- AI development is accelerating, with an increasing number of models being released each year (**Vellum AI, 2025**).

**Summary:** This section highlights the exponential growth of AI model development. Policymakers can track AIâ€™s regulatory needs (**CRFM, n.d.**), business leaders can anticipate upcoming innovations, and developers can identify trends in model evolution.

### **2. The AI Adoption Surge**

- AI is no longer experimentalâ€”25.1% of businesses have deployed AI (**Vellum AI, 2025**).
- But adoption is polarized**â€”another 25.1% are still developing their strategy (**Vellum AI, 2024a**).

**Summary:** This section explores how AI is being adopted across industries. Policymakers can shape regulations, businesses can assess their competitive stance (**Statista, 2024**), and developers can find areas where AI expertise is in demand.

### **3. What Are Companies Using AI For?**

- AI is mostly used for document parsing (59.7%), chatbots (51.4%), and natural language analytics (43.8%) (**Vellum AI, 2024b**).

**Summary:** AI is streamlining operations and improving efficiency (**Qlik, 2024**). Tech professionals can explore high-demand AI applications, businesses can evaluate AIâ€™s operational impact, and consumers can understand how AI influences their experiences.

### **4. Where Is AI Hosted?**

- 63.3% of companies use OpenAIâ€™s cloud, followed by Azure (33.8%) and Anthropic (32.3%) (**Vellum AI, 2025**).

**Summary:** AI hosting has major implications for data privacy, security, and sovereignty (**CRFM, n.d.**). Policymakers can evaluate risks, businesses can assess vendor lock-in concerns, and developers can explore new hosting architectures.

### **5. Where Is AI Developed?**

- 52.2% of companies build AI internally, while 29.9% use third-party platforms (**Vellum AI, 2024b**).

**Summary:** AI development approaches affect innovation speed and security. Policymakers can oversee data protection in AI models (**BRACAI, n.d.**), businesses can determine whether in-house development is feasible, and developers can assess career opportunities in AI engineering.

### **6. Challenges in AI Adoption**

- 57.1% struggle with hallucinations and prompt engineering (**Vellum AI, 2024a**).
- 38.3% cite a lack of technical expertise as a major barrier (**Tsang, 2023**).

**Summary:** This section identifies key obstacles to AI scaling. Policymakers can explore solutions for responsible AI governance, business leaders can strategize for smoother AI integration, and developers can address limitations like bias and hallucinations (**CRFM, n.d.**).

### **7. Call to Action: The Role of Different Stakeholders in AIâ€™s Future**

- Policymakers can develop AI governance frameworks that ensure fairness and transparency (**Vellum AI, 2025**).
- Businesses can invest in AI training and ethical AI deployment (**Qlik, 2024**).
- Developers can focus on improving AI reliability, fairness, and accessibility.
- Consumers can advocate for AI that aligns with their values and ethical considerations (**Statista, 2024**).

**Summary:** This section provides a roadmap for various stakeholders to shape AIâ€™s future responsibly. Policymakers can enforce accountability, businesses can ensure fair AI usage, developers can enhance AI's trustworthiness, and users can engage critically with AI systems.
