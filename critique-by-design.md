# Love Can Wait: How Women’s First Marriage Age Has Increased from 2006 to 2019
Redesigning Data Visualization: Median Age at First Marriage

## Step One: The Visualization

### **Original Visualization**
![Original Chart](average-age-of-women-at-first-marriage-by-state-vs-state-v0-4fp808kfvgk91.webp)

The original visualization was a scatter plot showing the relationship between **median age at first marriage** and **population density per square mile** across U.S. states. I selected this visualization because it aimed to uncover a potential correlation between urbanization and marriage trends, which is a valuable insight for policymakers, researchers, and sociologists. However, the scatter plot had **several weaknesses** that needed improvement.

## Step Two: The Critique

Using **Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile**, I evaluated the original scatter plot and identified several strengths and weaknesses:

### **Effectiveness Scale Ratings**

| Criteria            | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| **Usefulness**      |   |   |   |   |   |   | ✅ |   |   |    |
| **Completeness**    |   |   |   |   |   | ✅ |   |   |   |    |
| **Perceptibility**  |   |   |   |   | ✅ |   |   |   |   |    |
| **Truthfulness**    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | ✅ |   |    |
| **Intuitiveness**   |   |   |   |   | ✅ |   |   |   |   |    |
| **Aesthetics**      |   |   |   | ✅ |   |   |   |   |   |    |
| **Engagement**      |   |   |   | ✅ |   |   |   |   |   |    |

### **Key Takeaways from the Critique**

✅ **What Worked Well:**
- **Appropriate Visualization Type** – A scatter plot is suitable for showing relationships between continuous variables.
- **Truthfulness** – Data was accurately represented without manipulation.
- **Adequate Axis Labeling** – Both axes clearly defined the variables.

❌ **What Didn’t Work Well:**
- **No Trend Line** – Hard to interpret correlation without a guiding line.
- **Poor Label Readability** – Yellow background on axis labels made text difficult to read.
- **Lack of Context** – No geographic context (e.g., state-wise identification).
- **No Call to Action** – The graph didn't explain why this data mattered.
- **Missing Title** – The audience had no immediate understanding of what the visualization was about.

Based on these insights, I planned to **redesign the visualization** to provide better clarity, engagement, and usability.

## Step Three: Sketch a Solution

### **Redesign Plan:**
I created **two types of sketches** for the redesign:

1. **Choropleth Maps** – Two separate maps displaying **median ages across states**, one for **2006–2010** and another for **2015–2019**, to clearly show state-wise distribution.
2. **Arrow Plots** – A visual representation of how the median age changed between the two time periods across states, using arrows to indicate the shift in values.

These two approaches allow for **both geographical comparison and a clear visual representation of changes over time.** 

By using:
- **Choropleth maps**, viewers can easily compare **regional differences** in first marriage age for women across two different time periods.
- **Arrow plots**, they can quickly identify states where marriage age has increased or decreased, with the **length and direction of arrows** signifying the degree of change.

This redesign approach enhances both **clarity and engagement**, ensuring that policymakers, researchers, and the general public can grasp the key insights **at a glance**.

## Step Four: Test the Solution

### **User Feedback & Testing**

I conducted **two user interviews** to gather feedback on the redesigned sketch. The goal was to assess if the new visualization was easier to understand and more engaging.

#### **Interview Questions & Results**

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Can you tell me what you think this is? | "A relationship between marriage age and population density." | "Looks like a trend comparison between states on marriage age." |
| Can you describe to me what this is telling you? | "Higher density states have older marriage ages." | "There’s a pattern but needs a trend line to confirm." |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | "Some states are missing annotations." | "Could use color coding to group regions." |
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | "Researchers and policymakers." | "Could also be useful for journalists reporting on social trends." |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? | "More labels for outliers." | "Consider making bubbles bigger for high-density states." |

#### **Synthesis of Feedback**

- **Trend Line is Essential** – Viewers wanted a clearer indication of correlation.
- **State Annotations Should be Expanded** – More outliers should be labeled.
- **Color Coding by Region** – Some users suggested grouping states into regional colors.
- **Bubble Sizes Should be More Noticeable** – Scaling needed refinement for clarity.

## Step Five: Build the Solution

### **Final Visualization:**

### **Key Changes in the Final Design:**
1. **Bubble Chart Instead of Scatter Plot** – To **distinguish states clearly** while keeping correlation insights.
2. **Trend Line Added** – To confirm the positive correlation.
3. **Readable Labels** – Removed yellow background, improved contrast.
4. **Annotated Key States** – Highlighted outliers for better interpretation.
5. **Color Gradient for Better Differentiation** – Made bubbles visually distinct.

### **Final Thoughts on the Process**
This redesign process **significantly improved** the readability and usability of the visualization. The **Stephen Few critique method was useful for technical evaluation**, but it lacked a storytelling component, which became clear during user interviews. The redesigned visualization now serves **a broader audience** by making insights more apparent and engaging.
