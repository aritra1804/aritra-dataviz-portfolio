# Wireframes / Storyboards

Using the sketches developed, I further refined the story outline and created high-fidelity draft data visualizations for critical elements of my narrative. The Shorthand story draft is accessible here:

<script src="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-is-ai-really-an-energy-monster/embed.js"></script>

The story uses a scroll-driven structure with interactive visualizations, guiding the reader through AI's energy footprint.

# User Research

## Target Audience
The target audience includes:
- **Tech Enthusiasts & Developers**: Individuals interested in AI, data centers, and sustainability.
- **Policy Makers & Industry Leaders**: Stakeholders making decisions on energy use and AI infrastructure.
- **General Public**: Readers curious about AI's impact on energy and the environment.

### Approach to Identifying Participants
- Reached out to classmates in tech programs.
- Interviewed individuals from sustainability groups.
- Included non-technical users to ensure broad accessibility.

## Interview Script

### Research Goals
- Assess clarity of data visualizations.
- Understand user engagement with scroll-driven storytelling.
- Identify confusing or overwhelming data sections.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Clarity of narrative | "Was the story easy to follow? Were any parts confusing?" |
| Effectiveness of data visualizations | "Did the charts help clarify the points? Were any hard to interpret?" |
| User engagement with interactions | "Did the scroll effects and interactive visuals enhance your experience?" |
| Perceived bias or persuasion | "Did the story feel balanced or biased?" |
| Emotional and cognitive impact | "What part of the story stood out the most? Why?" |

## Interview Findings

### Thoughts After Interview
After receiving feedback from my professor and TA, I shifted the narrative from AI adoption for business to AI's energy consumption. This helped make the story more focused and relevant to energy concerns. Additionally, two interviewees mentioned that the story was too data-heavy and structured like a report, lacking a compelling narrative. Based on this, I reworked the storytelling approach to create a clearer structure and integrate data more organically into the story instead of presenting it in a rigid report-like format.

## Interview Findings

### Participants
1. Graduate Student in Computer Science (20s)
2. Policy Analyst in Sustainability (30s)
3. Non-technical Reader, Marketing Professional (40s)

| Questions | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Was the story easy to follow? | "Mostly, but Chapter 3 felt data-heavy." | "Yes, but local grid issues need emphasis. Also, it felt too much like a report." | "Some charts were overwhelming at first. The story felt a bit too data-centric." | "Yes, but local grid issues need emphasis." | "Some charts were overwhelming at first." |
| Did charts help clarify the points? | "Yes, especially the pie charts." | "The energy growth charts were insightful." | "The pie charts were easiest to understand." |
| Did scroll effects enhance experience? | "Yes, but some transitions felt too fast." | "I liked the animations for data growth." | "A bit too much motion at times." |
| Did the story feel balanced? | "Mostly balanced, could mention AI positives." | "Good, but some bias towards AI risks." | "Felt neutral overall." |
| What stood out most? | "The map showing local grid strain." | "The efficiency graph in Chapter 5." | "The comparison of AI vs. refrigeration." |

## Identified Changes for Part III

| Research Synthesis | Anticipated Changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Chapter 3 felt data-heavy | Break down charts into smaller sections; add more narrative around visuals. |
| Local grid issues need more emphasis | Expand Chapter 4 with more examples and user stories of local energy strain. |
| Some scroll effects felt too fast/overwhelming | Slow down transitions; add subtle cues to guide the reader through interactions. |
| Positive impacts of AI underrepresented | Add a section in Chapter 5 highlighting AI's role in optimizing energy use. |
| Complexity of certain charts | Simplify labels and legends; add short explanations near complex visuals. |

### Final Thoughts
The feedback highlighted the importance of balancing data with narrative, ensuring the story remains engaging without overwhelming the reader. For Part III, I will focus on refining interactions and improving clarity in data-heavy sections.
