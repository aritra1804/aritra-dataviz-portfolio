# Thoughts After Part I

After the initial round of feedback from my professor and TA, I made a significant shift in the focus of my story. Originally centered on AI adoption for businesses, the feedback highlighted the lack of narrative structure and the overly data-centric approach, making it feel more like a report. Based on this, I pivoted the story towards AI's energy consumption—a topic that offers clearer storytelling potential and aligns better with data-driven narratives.

# Wireframes / Storyboards

Using the sketches developed in part I, I further refined the story outline and created high-fidelity draft data visualizations for critical elements of my narrative. The Shorthand story draft is accessible here:

The story uses a scroll-driven structure with interactive visualizations, guiding the reader through AI's energy footprint.

# User Research

## Target Audience
The target audience primarily includes the **general public**. After receiving feedback from Part I, I chose to explain the story in very simple terms to make it accessible to everyone. With tools like ChatGPT and Google AI being widely used, I wanted to raise awareness about the energy implications of AI through this story.

My secondary audience includes **industry leaders** and **policy makers** who play a key role in planning for energy efficiency and sustainability.

### Approach to Identifying Participants
- Reached out to classmates in different academic programs to get diverse perspectives.
- Included individuals with varying levels of technical expertise to ensure the story is universally accessible.

- Reached out to classmates in tech programs.
- Interviewed individuals from sustainability groups.
- Included non-technical users to ensure broad accessibility.

## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Comprehension | "What do you understand by this story?" |
| Effectiveness of data visualizations | "How did the data visualizations help (or not help) you understand the topic?" |
| Clarity | "Were there any sections of the story that were confusing?" |

| Constructive feedback | "What is one thing you would change to improve the story?" |


## Interview Findings

### Participants
1. Student (MAM)
2. Student (BIDA)
3. Student (MISM)
4. Student (MEM)

| Questions | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 | Interview 4 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Was the story easy to follow? | "Mostly, but Chapter 3 felt data-heavy." | "Yes, but local grid issues need emphasis. Also, it felt too much like a report." | "Some charts were overwhelming at first. The story felt a bit too data-centric." | "Yes, but background images made some text hard to read." |
| Did charts help clarify the points? | "Yes, especially the pie charts." | "The energy growth charts were insightful." | "The pie charts were easiest to understand." | "The stacked bar charts were very helpful." |
| Did scroll effects enhance experience? | "Yes, but some transitions felt too fast." | "I liked the animations for data growth." | "A bit too much motion at times." | "The scroll effect in Chapter 3 was my favorite." |
| Did the story feel balanced? | "Mostly balanced, could mention AI positives." | "Good, but some bias towards AI risks." | "Felt neutral overall." | "Balanced, but background images were distracting." |
| What stood out most? | "The map showing local grid strain." | "The efficiency graph in Chapter 5." | "The comparison of AI vs. refrigeration." | "The scroll-driven visualization in Chapter 3." |

### Additional Feedback
- One interviewee highlighted that the **scroll effect in Chapter 3** was particularly engaging.
- Another interviewee suggested **reducing the background image brightness** to improve text readability.

### Feedback from TA

After completing the interviews, I sought additional feedback from my TA to refine the project further. The TA provided the following suggestions:

- **Simplify Text Formatting:** The TA noted that the text in my Shorthand draft was **too heavy for the eyes**. She recommended reformatting the text to improve readability and create a more engaging experience.
  
- **Highlight Data More Effectively:** The TA suggested finding an **easier and simpler way** to highlight key data points within the narrative. This includes using visual cues like bold text, callouts, or cleaner layouts to make important information stand out.

- **Include Proper Citations:** The TA emphasized the importance of adding **citations for all data visualizations** used in the story. Proper attribution will improve the credibility and academic rigor of the project.

These insights will guide my improvements in **Part III**, focusing on enhancing readability, highlighting data more effectively, and ensuring proper citations throughout the Shorthand story.

### Thoughts After Interview
After receiving feedback from my professor, TA, and interviewees, I made several important changes to the project. Initially focused on AI adoption for business, the story shifted towards **AI’s energy consumption** to create a more focused and relevant narrative around energy concerns.

Interviewees highlighted that the story was **too data-heavy** and structured like a report, lacking a compelling narrative. To address this, I reworked the storytelling approach to integrate data more organically and create a clearer structure.

Additional feedback pointed out that the **Shorthand draft was visually overwhelming**, with dense blocks of text and complex visualizations. Users suggested a **side-by-side layout** for text and visualizations to enhance readability and engagement.

From the TA’s feedback, I learned that the **text formatting needed simplification** to be easier on the eyes. She also emphasized the need for a **simpler method to highlight key data points** and advised adding **citations** for all data visualizations to improve credibility.

For **Part III**, I will focus on:
- Implementing a **side-by-side layout** for text and visualizations.
- Simplifying text formatting for better readability.
- Highlighting key data points more effectively.
- Reducing data density and breaking down complex sections.
- Adding **citations** to all data visualizations.



## Identified Changes for Part III

| Research Synthesis | Anticipated Changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Story felt too data-heavy and report-like | Integrate data into the narrative more smoothly; focus on storytelling over pure data presentation. |
| Text formatting was visually overwhelming | Simplify text blocks, use  less bullet points, more callouts, and more whitespace to improve readability. |
| Users prefer side-by-side layout | Implement a side-by-side layout in Shorthand to pair text with visuals for better engagement. |
| Scroll effects felt too fast/overwhelming | Slow down transitions and provide visual cues to guide the reader through interactions. |
| Complex charts were hard to interpret | Simplify labels, legends, and break down complex charts into smaller, more digestible parts. |
| Need for clearer data highlights | Use callouts, bold text, and cleaner layouts to emphasize key data points. |
| Missing citations on visualizations | Add proper citations for all data visualizations to improve credibility. |



### Final Thoughts
The feedback from the TA and interviewees emphasized the importance of balancing narrative and data while maintaining visual clarity. For **Part III**, I will focus on creating a more engaging, user-friendly experience by simplifying the text, restructuring the layout, and making the data easier to digest. Implementing the suggested changes will ensure that the story remains accessible to a broad audience while maintaining depth and credibility.
