# Thoughts After Part I

After the initial round of feedback from my professor and TA, I made a significant shift in the focus of my story. Originally centered on AI adoption for businesses, the feedback highlighted the lack of narrative structure and the overly data-centric approach, making it feel more like a report. Based on this, I pivoted the story towards AI's energy consumption—a topic that offers clearer storytelling potential and aligns better with data-driven narratives.

# Wireframes / Storyboards

Using the sketches developed, I further refined the story outline and created high-fidelity draft data visualizations for critical elements of my narrative. The Shorthand story draft is accessible here:

The story uses a scroll-driven structure with interactive visualizations, guiding the reader through AI's energy footprint.

# User Research

## Target Audience
The target audience primarily includes the **general public**. After receiving feedback from Part I, I chose to explain the story in very simple terms to make it accessible to everyone. With tools like ChatGPT and Google AI being widely used, I wanted to raise awareness about the energy implications of AI through this story.

My secondary audience includes **industry leaders** and **policy makers** who play a key role in planning for energy efficiency and sustainability.

### Approach to Identifying Participants
- Reached out to classmates in different academic programs to get diverse perspectives.
- Included individuals with varying levels of technical expertise to ensure the story is universally accessible.

- Reached out to classmates in tech programs.
- Interviewed individuals from sustainability groups.
- Included non-technical users to ensure broad accessibility.

## Interview Script

### Research Goals
- Understand the main message users take away from the story.
- Assess clarity and impact of data visualizations.
- Identify confusing or overwhelming sections.
- Highlight elements that resonate positively.
- Gather suggestions for improvements.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Comprehension | "What do you understand by this story?" |
| Effectiveness of data visualizations | "How did the data visualizations help (or not help) you understand the topic?" |
| Clarity | "Were there any sections of the story that were confusing?" |
| Positive feedback | "What is one thing you liked the most about the story?" |
| Constructive feedback | "What is one thing you would change to improve the story?" |

## Interview Findings

### Thoughts After Interview
After receiving feedback from my professor and TA, I shifted the narrative from AI adoption for business to AI's energy consumption. This helped make the story more focused and relevant to energy concerns. Additionally, two interviewees mentioned that the story was too data-heavy and structured like a report, lacking a compelling narrative. Based on this, I reworked the storytelling approach to create a clearer structure and integrate data more organically into the story instead of presenting it in a rigid report-like format.

Users also expressed a preference for a layout where text and visualizations are presented side by side. They found the current Shorthand draft too data-heavy and suggested making the narrative more engaging and less overwhelming. In Part III, I will focus on implementing a side-by-side layout, reducing data density, and enhancing the narrative flow to create a more balanced and engaging user experience.

## Interview Findings

### Participants
1. Student (MAM)
2. Student (BIDA)
3. Student (MISM)
4. Student (MEM)

| Questions | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Was the story easy to follow? | "Mostly, but Chapter 3 felt data-heavy." | "Yes, but local grid issues need emphasis. Also, it felt too much like a report." | "Some charts were overwhelming at first. The story felt a bit too data-centric." | "Yes, but local grid issues need emphasis." | "Some charts were overwhelming at first." |
| Did charts help clarify the points? | "Yes, especially the pie charts." | "The energy growth charts were insightful." | "The pie charts were easiest to understand." |
| Did scroll effects enhance experience? | "Yes, but some transitions felt too fast." | "I liked the animations for data growth." | "A bit too much motion at times." |
| Did the story feel balanced? | "Mostly balanced, could mention AI positives." | "Good, but some bias towards AI risks." | "Felt neutral overall." |
| What stood out most? | "The map showing local grid strain." | "The efficiency graph in Chapter 5." | "The comparison of AI vs. refrigeration." |

## Identified Changes for Part III

| Research Synthesis | Anticipated Changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Chapter 3 felt data-heavy | Break down charts into smaller sections; add more narrative around visuals. |
| Local grid issues need more emphasis | Expand Chapter 4 with more examples and user stories of local energy strain. |
| Some scroll effects felt too fast/overwhelming | Slow down transitions; add subtle cues to guide the reader through interactions. |
| Positive impacts of AI underrepresented | Add a section in Chapter 5 highlighting AI's role in optimizing energy use. |
| Complexity of certain charts | Simplify labels and legends; add short explanations near complex visuals. |

### Final Thoughts
The feedback highlighted the importance of balancing data with narrative, ensuring the story remains engaging without overwhelming the reader. For Part III, I will focus on refining interactions and improving clarity in data-heavy sections.
